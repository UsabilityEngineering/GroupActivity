# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

There are a lot of people that would like a simple and easy way of planning events. With clear options for the user such as reminding them of upcoming events, adding friends, accepting and declining proposals, and showing availability. We believe Group Activity provides an easier and more efficient way of connecting users than our competitors. 

## Methods

We conducted competitive analysis and heuristic evaluation 
* Competitive analysis - 
  * We identified our leading competitors as Facebook Events, iMessage Group Chats, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Time Tree, and physical planners, from our current understanding of what is most popular. Through competitive analysis, we were able to analyze competitors' strengths and weaknesses. For example, what their strengths, weaknesses, Quality level, Price/Cost, and what platforms competitors operate on. 
* Heuristic evaluation: comparison of our top competitor, Google Calendar and the top usability heuristics for user interface design
  * Visibility of system status - Users awareness of the current state of the application, no changes happening without informing the user.
  * Match between system and the real world - Is the design in line with what the user already knows outside of the application, the design is intuitive and second nature in the eyes of the user.
  * User control and freedom - if users make an action they are in full control of what they do next, the ability to proceed or end a task at need.
  * Consistency and Standards - Is the design of the application in line with the standards of other similar and competing applications, this can be both good and bad.
  * Error prevention - Error codes and error messages are provided if and when errors occur.
  * Recognition rather than recall - the user should be able to use the application intuitively without the need to memorize systems within the application.
  * Flexibility and efficiency of use - does the design cater to both experienced and inexperienced users.
  * Aesthetic and minimalist design - the interface is not cluttered and only contains relevant information that the user needs.
  * Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors - Error messaging should be clear and precise and should let the users know what exactly is being  done wrong.
  * Help and documentation - Provide documentation if it is necessary for users to know how to fully use the application.


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
