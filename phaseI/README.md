# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

There are a lot of people that would like a simple and easy way of planning events. With clear options for the user such as reminding them of upcoming events, adding friends, accepting and declining proposals, and showing availability. We believe Group Activity provides an easier and more efficient way of connecting users than our competitors. 

## Methods

We conducted competitive analysis and heuristic evaluation 
* Competitive analysis - 
  * We identified our leading competitors as Facebook Events, iMessage Group Chats, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Time Tree, and physical planners, from our current understanding of what is most popular. Through competitive analysis, we were able to analyze competitors' strengths and weaknesses. For example, what their strengths, weaknesses, Quality level, Price/Cost, and what platforms competitors operate on. 
* Heuristic evaluation: comparison of our top competitor, Google Calendar and the top usability heuristics for user interface design
  * Visibility of system status - Users awareness of the current state of the application, no changes happening without informing the user.
  * Match between system and the real world - Is the design in line with what the user already knows outside of the application, the design is intuitive and second nature in the eyes of the user.
  * User control and freedom - if users make an action they are in full control of what they do next, the ability to proceed or end a task at need.
  * Consistency and Standards - Is the design of the application in line with the standards of other similar and competing applications, this can be both good and bad.
  * Error prevention - Error codes and error messages are provided if and when errors occur.
  * Recognition rather than recall - the user should be able to use the application intuitively without the need to memorize systems within the application.
  * Flexibility and efficiency of use - does the design cater to both experienced and inexperienced users.
  * Aesthetic and minimalist design - the interface is not cluttered and only contains relevant information that the user needs.
  * Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors - Error messaging should be clear and precise and should let the users know what exactly is being  done wrong.
  * Help and documentation - Provide documentation if it is necessary for users to know how to fully use the application.


## Findings

* Competitive Analysis findings proved: 
 * Competitors failed in uploading a user's current availability. Room for improvement in user to user connectivity, displaying availability and communicating plans. Most applications failed in usability and learnability, not including demos or introduction videos to the app when needed. Competitors such as planner books and iMessage group chats proved to be low quality due to their lack of permanency and frustration. Top competitors such as Google Calendar and Apple Calendar, proved to have zero cost to the user, availability on all platforms, and had good learnability. Cost of almost all competitors with the exception of physical planning books was zero.
* Heuristic Evaluation findings proved:
 * We found the competitor Google Calendars to be nearly perfect in every aspect in our heuristic analysis. The design has been thought through and is easy for users to use and understand. Error prevention and error messaging was found to be nearly irrelevant in regards to this competitor not leaving much room in the application to create errors. The one area where things get complicated is within Recognition rather than recall, where the users can edit the application with settings, and addons which may make using the platform more complicated for users. Through this errors could potentially crop up and error messaging may not be implemented for additional features that were not initially intended.



## Conclusions

From our discoveries through methods and findings we were able to identify new insights to our UX design. Our competitors provide an efficient way of planning events, however we would like to provide the same functionality but in a more easy-to-use way. 
* Based upon our findings from competitive analysis, we understand our app must have strong learnability, must be free, and must be available on all platforms in order to compete with existing products.  Unlike competitors, Group Activity allows the user to upload their current availability to their app, allowing their specified added friends to see their schedules. Similar to competitors like Time Tree and Facebook Events, Group Activity will allow for the adding of friends. 
* Based upon our heuristic evaluation of Google Calendar, we found that there was not much room for improvement in regards to functionality. Google Calendar has great UX and overall provides an exceptional format for us to work on. 


## Caveats

* Competing products of GroupActivity are widely used and popular among large groups of people. Competing products are often preinstalled on parent devices (such as Google Calendar on Google devices, Apple Calendar on Apple devices). Currently, we have no user experience trials and feedback. 
* The current methods have been performed by people who are new to user experience, heuristic evaluation, and competitive analysis, therefore findings may be subjective.
