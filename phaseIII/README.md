# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

A simple and easy way of planning events is crucial in order to have a stress free social calendar. With clear options for the user such as reminding them of upcoming events, adding friends, accepting and declining proposals, and showing availability. We believe Group Activity provides an easier and more efficient way of connecting users than our competitors.

## Methods

* Our user testing was based around five participants, each of which were asked to complete background questions, 3 tasks with the protocol, and a debrief, all while utilizing the ‘think out loud method’. In addition to the think out loud method, we gathered audio recordings of the testing, utilized a notetaker, and a facilitator to guide the participants. Data was collected through audio recording, a data sheet, and physical notes. 
* The Background portion of the user testing gathered information about the user’s previous experiences with online event planning, time scheduling, and use of physical planners. 
* Tasks users were asked to complete included logging into an existing account, creating an event, sending invites, accepting/declining invites, changing publicity settings of events, and viewing current events through the calendar view. After completing tasks users were asked to rate their levels of Satisfaction, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Memorability, Usefulness, Learnability, Error Tolerance, Safety, during the task.
* The Debrief portion allowed us to understand the user’s overall feeling toward the product, and gather any possible complaints they may have had during the user testing experience. 


## Findings

### User Backgrounds:
* Most participants had experience with using an online planner through other websites such as google calendar, outlook planner, and apple calendar. Participants used these applications due to their accessibility and ease of use when planning events. 
* Some participants had no experience using a planner or calendar application and had either lived with the chaos that such a lifestyle provides or had instead used physical handwritten planners and calendars.
	
### Task 1 Findings:
* Participants were able to complete this task easily and as intended, some confusion and questions came up regarding specific information around the people they were accepting and sending invites to but the act of completing the task was completed as intended with nearly perfect scores with the SEEMULES usability standards.

### Task 2 Findings:
* Participants had no problem completing task 2, however they were a little confused whether their event was made public or private to their friends. Participant 2 said, “there was no indication of whether or not people could see the event or not”. Also there was an additional instance where another participant said he wasn't “sure what would happen if [they] declined the invitation”. Other than that we received a score average of 7 for our SEEMULES tests. 

### Task 3 Findings:
* All participants were able to complete the task with no trouble at all, everything was easy and clear enough for them to understand what they were doing and how the website worked. Our SEEMULES average for this task was 10.

### Debrief:
* Participants found that while the Group Activity prototype did not have many of the features that other applications had, but they felt like its simplicity and direct approach in planning events with friends was preferable over the complicated approach to setting them up elsewhere.


## Conclusions

* Through our findings we were able to identify issues we had with our application. Most of the issues we had involved task 2 as participants were unsure what would happen if they declined an event or if their event actually became public when clicking the public button. In our revision of our prototype we will leave the invitation on our invite list after it is declined until the date of the event. For our public/private issue, we will automatically set our events to private, giving the user the option to make them public. Hopefully removing the confusion that feature is creating.
* Overall our prototype seems to be moving in the right direction. Participant feedback was mostly positive and issues we discovered through our findings have been recorded and can be resolved in future work.


## Caveats

* Caveats to our study may include a restriction of participants used within the study. Because each of the five participants are also in the Usability Engineering Class CSCI 430W, they may have had a different set of expectations going into the usability testing. These expectations could range from a difference in technological ability and natural problem solving skills, differing from the average population.
* Another caveat being that with the limited number of participants it is harder to get good and varied participant results especially when these results are reliant on making sure all participants are show up and accounted for.
* Another caveat could be the age group of our participants. Most of the participants are in their 20’s or younger. We would like our planner to be used by people of all ages, including those around the age of 40 or older.
