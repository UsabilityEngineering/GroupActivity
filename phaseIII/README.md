# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

A simple and easy way of planning events is crucial in order to have a stress free social calendar. With clear options for the user such as reminding them of upcoming events, adding friends, accepting and declining proposals, and showing availability. We believe Group Activity provides an easier and more efficient way of connecting users than our competitors.

## Methods

* Our user testing was based around five participants, each of which were asked to complete background questions, 3 tasks with the protocol, and a debrief, all while utilizing the ‘think out loud method’. In addition to the think out loud method, we gathered audio recordings of the testing, utilized a notetaker, and a facilitator to guide the participants. Data was collected through audio recording, a data sheet, and physical notes. 
* The Background portion of the user testing gathered information about the user’s previous experiences with online event planning, time scheduling, and use of physical planners. 
* Tasks users were asked to complete included logging into an existing account, creating an event, sending invites, accepting/declining invites, changing publicity settings of events, and viewing current events through the calendar view. After completing tasks users were asked to rate their levels of Satisfaction, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Memorability, Usefulness, Learnability, Error Tolerance, Safety, during the task.
* The Debrief portion allowed us to understand the user’s overall feeling toward the product, and gather any possible complaints they may have had during the user testing experience. 


## Findings

### User Backgrounds:
* Most users had experience with using an online planner through other websites such as google calendar, outlook planner, and apple calendar. Users used these applications due to their accessibility and ease of use when planning events. 
* Some users had no experience using a planner or calendar application and had either lived with the chaos that such a lifestyle provides or had instead used physical handwritten planners and calendars.
	
### Task 1 Findings:
* Users were able to complete this task easily and as intended, some confusion and questions came up regarding specific information around the people they were accepting and sending invites to but the act of completing the task was completed as intended with nearly perfect scores with the SEEMULES usability standards except one instance where a user rated error tolerance with a 7 because he “wasn't sure what would happen if [he] declined the invitation”.

	### Task 2 Findings:
* Users had no problem completing task 2, however they were a little confused on whether their event was made public or private to their friends. P2 said, “there was no indication of whether or not people could see the event or not.” Other than that we received a score average of 7 for our SEEMULES tests. 

	### Task 3 Findings:
* All users were able to complete the task with no trouble at all, everything was easy and clear enough for them to understand what they were doing and how the website worked. Our SEEMULES average for this task was 10.


## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

* Caveats to our study may include a restriction of participants used within the study. Because each of the five participants are also in the Usability Engineering Class CSCI 430W, they may have had a different set of expectations going into the usability testing. These expectations could range from a difference in technological ability and natural problem solving skills, differing from the average population.
* Another caveat being that we were unable to complete the test with one of the five participants because he failed to show up.
