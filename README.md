# Group Activity

Group Activity is a web project designed to make organizing and planning events with friends easier, The problem we intend to solve is getting rid of cumbersome group chats that deviate into all kinds of off topic conversations and make a app that allows users to interact to and talk with friends while also keeping upto date and schedule events to attend, sortof a rsvp app mixed with a calendar app!

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**
People of all demographics have social lives and busy schedules throughout the day. Oftentimes it is hard for people to find the room to make space for both in their time. Group Activity will innovate how people interact and plan social events with each other while keeping in mind the busy schedules we keep throughout the day.
* We conducted competitive analysis on leading products we found to be strong competitors in what users would use our application for.
* We conducted heuristic evaluations on the competitor we found to be the strongest in what our users would be looking for.
* We created personas and made scenarios that reflected the user stories.
* Illustrated sketches and diagrams for how we think the application should look based on the needs of our personas

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**
People of all demographics have social lives and busy schedules throughout the day. Oftentimes it is hard for people to find the room to make space for both in their time. Group Activity will innovate how people interact and plan social events with each other while keeping in mind the busy schedules we keep throughout the day.
* We created wireframes to reflect how the application user interface would look at the most basic design.
* We transitioned from a basic wireframe to an interactive prototype including the interface's most basic functions in order to suit our predetermined personas and scenarios. 
* By outsourcing users in order to conduct cognitive walkthroughs and simulate persona scenarios while interacting with our prototype, we received feedback where our current design may need improvement.
* Feedback from cognitive walkthroughs include: Users wish for a clearer understanding of the contact information needed on a friend invite. Instead of a binary response (accept/decline) to invitations, provide a way to chat between the users. Provide more context in our invitation regarding the event description. Make the wording on our wireframe clearer and more understandable.
* Through in person collaboration with our Software Engineering team, we exchanged additional feedback in order to streamline our teamâ€™s thoughts to better the user experience with Group Activity.
