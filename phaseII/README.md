# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

A simple and easy way of planning events is crucial in order to have a stress free social calendar.  With clear options for the user such as reminding them of upcoming events, adding friends, accepting and declining proposals, and showing availability. We believe Group Activity provides an easier and more efficient way of connecting users than our competitors.

## Methods

In order to test the usability of our product, we created wireframes. Our wireframes created a basic and spatially organized example of Group Activity. We transitioned from a basic wireframe to a prototype by implementing the foreseen tasks of Group Activity.  By utilizing outside parties, we were able to test our basic prototype from a user’s point of view, through cognitive walkthroughs. 

Our third party tester utilized our previously outlined Personas and Scenarios, in order to complete the desired tasks within the prototype. Our testers implemented a task-based usability-inspection, and reported back their findings and feedback, allowing us to understand any changes that must be made to Group Activity. 

Through collaboration with our SE team, we were able to determine changes that can be made to visual design for a stronger product. 


## Findings

After creating our wireframe, prototype, and implementing usability testing, we have been given feedback on Group Activity. Our usability testing defined what changes need to be made to Group Activity. 

Specifically: 
* Provide more context in our invitation regarding the event description.
* Make the wording on our wireframe more clear and understandable.
* Instead of a binary response (accept/decline) to invitations, provide a way to chat between the users.
* Desire to add a presentation of users availability in the wireframe.
* User wishes it were more clear if emails or phone numbers should be used
* User wants to be able to send reminders, and see if their invitees use the same interface

As a team, we also received positive feedback from our usability testing, including: 
* User was happy with the ability to create an account 
* The user had an easy time familiarizing themself with the interface 
* The ability to create invite went smoothly 
* User was able to make an account and sign on
* User is satisfied with the ability to make and view events
* User is happy to be able to click on events for further information
* User was able to satisfy his needs with the application and achieved his goal.

Through informal feedback from our accompanying SE team, changes such as simplifying the pop up windows on the website, unifying the different sections onto the home page to declutter the screen space were outlined as ways to improve the user experience.


## Conclusions

Taking the feedback from the cognitive walkthroughs, we hope to implement a binary response (accept/decline) to invitations, a clearer indication of email or phone, and an area for a description within an invite. 

From our SE team’s criticism, we plan to incorporate a more seamless interface, with essentially a split screen. Currently, we have a calendar main view with a side bar for upcoming events. We want to transition from a stagnant sidebar of upcoming events to a sidebar of whatever the user chooses to have open. This could be menu, invites, current events, or any other tabs available. The goal is to create less ‘pop-up’ tabs and instead insert them into the side bar area. This will create a less hectic screen for the user, and will create an easier to understand interface. 


## Caveats

Even though our Usability Testers were a third party, they are also participating in CSCI 430W, giving them a different viewpoint than the typical user. This could influence their experience while interacting with our prototype, and therefore affect their usability report. 

Given the limited scope of the wireframe prototype, the viewpoints of the Usability Testers on working with the product will be different than that of a typical user. The functionality of a more developed prototype would be more extensive than the prototype used. This may affect the tester’s experience.
